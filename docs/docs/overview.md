# Transcoder Overview

The Transcoder plugin allows you to transcode any video or animated GIF (local or remote) to any size, bitrate, framerate, and save it out as a web-ready video in a variety of file formats.

It can also transcode audio files to any bitrate & sample rate, to a variety of file formats. It can even extract audio tracks from video files.

Transcoder also allows you to get a thumbnail of a video in any size and at any timecode, and can extract information about audio/video files such. It also automatically adds video thumbnails in the Assets index in the Control Panel.

Finally, it lets you download an arbitrary file (such as the transcoded video) via a special download link.

If the source file has changed since the last time the video/audio was transcoded, it will re-encode the file and replace it.
